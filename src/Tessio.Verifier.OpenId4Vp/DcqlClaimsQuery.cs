// What belongs in this file: turning claim declarations into the `claims` and `claim_sets` JSON a DCQL
// credential entry carries, and refusing a request the specification says is malformed. Nothing about
// the credential entry around them, which is Dcql's job.
//
// EVERY RULE BELOW THAT COMES FROM THE SPECIFICATION CITES ITS CLAUSE, and that is not decoration. The
// plain null and empty-string guards cite nothing, because they are ordinary argument checks rather
// than protocol rules, and that distinction IS the point: a refusal that is not an argument check
// answers to a clause, so the clause goes in the comment.
//
// The reason to insist on it: a list of rules assembled by imagining what a careless caller gets wrong
// is not the same list as §6.1, §6.3 and §7.2, and the difference is invisible from inside. Every rule
// those sections carry fails the same silent way when a builder omits it. The query serialises perfectly,
// the wallet answers with no claims, and that reads as the holder having nothing to offer rather than as
// a malformed request. So a PROTOCOL rule with no citation is one somebody invented. Add the citation, or
// do not add the rule.
