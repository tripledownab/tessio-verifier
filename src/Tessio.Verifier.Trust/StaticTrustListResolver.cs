/// its chain anchors on one of <c>trustAnchors</c> (or the leaf itself is a pinned anchor); the
/// identifier is <em>not</em> required to be on the list, because anyone can put any name in a
/// certificate, so the X.509 chain is the proof. This is the only mechanism ISO mdoc has, where the
/// issuer identifier is a Document Signer subject DN that no list enumerates. Binding the certificate
/// to a claimed issuer, where that applies, is the caller's concern: SD-JWT VC ties <c>iss</c> to a
/// certificate SAN before this point, but ONLY where the leaf asserts a name. A leaf that asserts none
/// cannot contradict <c>iss</c>, and the specification makes its subject the issuer, so for that leaf
/// anchoring is the whole of the proof. Without configured anchors, x5c credentials are rejected.
